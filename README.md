In our fictional battle today, the giant would be [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the super-power open-source programming language. The underdog would be [DMWay](http://dmway.com/), the “new kid in town”: An Israeli start-up which develops AI approach to predictive analytics, and claims to enable faster and better predictive models. Will their combat end as the old myth? Which of the two rivals enables to build better predictive models? What can we learn from their contest about “People Analytics” practices? Let’s begin the fight in the arena of **predicting employee attrition**.
